# Sound-Station
Using Sallen-Key filter topology, I assembled low-pass and high-pass filters for treble and bass components followed by respective amplifiers (using MOSFET transistors). Furthermore, I powered the audio docking station by building my own AC/DC power supply by implementing a transformer, full-wave rectifier, smoothing filter, and voltage regulator.
